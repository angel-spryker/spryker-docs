description: This document allows you to assess if a project has multi-store support.

To estimate the additional effort for aligning the project's usage of the multi-store concept to our default one, do the following:

* In `config/Shared/stores.php`, check the multi-store settings.
* Clarify with the customer how different multi-store concept usage is from the default Spryker multi-store concept:
    * Is it single database per store?
    * Are stores deployed simultaneously?
    * How do URLs build per store?
