## Description

We are interested here in assets files and any other files used by the Spryker project and stored separately from git.

1. Request this information from the customer for assessment, size of:
    * images;
    * videos.
2. Clarify confidence for the quality of the asset, if those assets are really necessary to use and transfer to Spryker Cloud.
