# Integrate the latest version of Docker SDK and run project on it

{% info_block infoBox %}

## Resources Backend, DevOps[optional]

{% endinfo_block %}

1. Create boot files for all required environments using the following pattern `deploy.(projectname)-(environmentname).yml`
    and the following [example](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.spryker-b2c-staging.yml).
2. Boot local development environment based on newly created deploy file and ensure that the local env is working well.
3. In sync with the cloud engineer check the naming of hosts for services per each environment.
4. Deploy other environments in Spryker PaaS and ensure they are running well with new/updated boot files.
   The first deployment of any environment has to be in destructive mode.
5. Custom applications have to be added by DevOps, the following instructions are needed in case it is not part of Spryker applications:
    * app name;
    * hostname;
    * Docker file in order to build an image.
        * Docker container with this image has to be able to respond to HTTP queries;
    * list of required ENV variables;
    * a port which has to be dedicated to the application inside the docker container;
    * [optional] instructions on how to run the application.
6. Default Spryker applications will be working fine right away (see the list in [demoshop](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.aws-env-template.yml#L80)):
    * Yves;
    * Zed;
    * Glue;
    * Backoffice;
    * Backend-gateway;
    * Merchant-portal.
7. Custom services have to be replaced by default with Spryker PaaS services, see details [here](/docs/scos/dev/migration-program/migration-to-paas/paas-migration-documents/migrate-non-standard-services.html).
